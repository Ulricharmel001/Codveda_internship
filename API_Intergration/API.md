# Project Explanation â€” API Integration (CoinGecko)

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Python program with an external API. The script uses the public CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data without needing an API key.
It allows the user to enter the name of any cryptocurrency and returns details such as the current price, market capitalization, 24-hour high and low, price change percentage, and trading volume.

The implementation uses the requests library to make HTTP GET calls and handles possible errors like invalid input or network issues. The data is displayed in a simple and readable format for easy understanding.
This task shows how APIs can be used to connect applications with real-world data sources, an essential skill for backend and software development.
